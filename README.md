#  Multi-Agent Smart Traffic Management System

A simulation system that uses multiple AI agents â€” smart traffic lights, vehicles, and drones â€” to dynamically manage urban traffic and reduce congestion.

##  Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion leads to significant time loss, pollution, and fuel consumption. Traditional traffic lights are static and cannot adapt to real-time conditions.

##  Our Solution

We designed a multi-agent system where:

-  **TrafficLightAgent** adjusts signals based on real-time traffic data.
-  **VehicleAgent** communicates with infrastructure (V2I) for smarter routing.
-  **(Optional) DroneAgent** can detect road incidents from above.
-  Event-driven communication allows agents to collaborate effectively.

##  Key Features

- Dynamic traffic signal control based on vehicle density
- Real-time rerouting of vehicles using simulated V2I
- Rush hour simulation with multiple agents and intersections
- State preservation for each agent (resume logic)
- Modular architecture with easy integration
